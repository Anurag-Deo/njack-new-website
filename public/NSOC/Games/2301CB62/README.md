# NSOC-Project-1
Hey there! This is my project-1 for the nsoc event conducted by NJACK, IIT Patna.
The theme of the project is IIT Patna, so I tried making a fun game in which there is a security guard/watchman whose duty is to watch over the nilgais that roam over the campus sometimes causing trouble to the students who travels with cycle in general.
Thus to prevent such sort of incidents, in this game the player is the guard who frighten off the nilgais.
The player needs to click on the nilgai to earn 10 points per each click, but wait there is a catch; the guard cannot hit/click the student on bicycle. If he does then it's GAME OVER!
Enjoy the game :)
